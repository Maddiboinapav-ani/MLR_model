# MLR_model
Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is an extension of simple linear regression, 
where more than one independent variable is used to predict the value of a dependent (target) variable.
It is one of the most commonly used models in statistics and machine learning for predicting a continuous outcome based on several predictor variables.

Suppose you are trying to predict the price of a house based on multiple features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and location score. 
In this case, multiple linear regression can be used to predict the house price based on these predictors.
